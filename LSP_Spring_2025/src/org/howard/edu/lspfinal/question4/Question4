While design patterns can make code more flexible and reusable, they aren’t always the best solution. As we discussed in class, they can sometimes lead to overly complicated designs. Another challenge is the lack of standardization in how patterns are indexed or organized, making it difficult to determine which one to use in a given situation. Additionally, unless a company’s style guide is extremely detailed, there are no clear, established processes for when to apply patterns during the design phase. Because of this, using design patterns can sometimes introduce unnecessary confusion, especially when a simpler solution would have worked and saved time.
